[![vib-build](https://github.com/c0deplayer/vanillaplus-os/actions/workflows/vib-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c0deplayer/vanillaplus-os/actions/workflows/vib-build.yml)

Vanilla+ OS is based on [Vanilla-OS/custom-image](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/custom-image), which makes it easy to create your own custom image-based Vanilla OS experience.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
